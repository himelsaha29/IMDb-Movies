SQL queries about IMDb database of movies.

Usage: cat filename.sql | sqlite3 movies.db

This program uses SQLite 3 to query a SQLite database that stores data from IMDb about movies, the people who directed and starred in them, and their ratings.
'Movies' table has an id column that uniquely identifies each movie, along with columns for the title of a movie and the year in which the movie was released. The people table also has an id column, columns for each personâ€™s name and birth year. Movie ratings are stored in the ratings table. The first column in the table is movie_id: a foreign key that references the id of the movies table. The rest of the row contains data about the rating for each movie and the number of votes the movie has received on IMDb. The stars and directors tables match people to the movies in which they acted or directed. (Only principal stars and directors are included.) Each table has just two columns: movie_id and person_id, which reference a specific movie and person, respectively.
